Risk Management Terminology:

    Security professional use their knowledge and skills to examine
    operatioanl risk management, deteremine how to use risk data 
    effectively, work cross-functionally and report actionable
    information and findings to the stakeholders concerned. Terms such
    as threats, vulnerabilities and assets are familiar to most 
    cybersecurity professionals.
    
An asset is something in need of protection.

A vulnerability is a gap or weakness in those protection efforts.

A threat is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts.

Threats:

    A threat is a person or thing that takes action to exploit (or make use of)
    a target organization's system vulnerabilities, as part of achieving or futhering
    its goal or objectives.
    
    A Threat Vector: The means by which a threat actor carries out their objectives.
    
Vulnerabilities:

    A vulnerability is an inherent weakness or flaw in a system or component, which, if
    triggered or acted upon, could cause a risk event to occur.
    
Likelihood:

    When determining an organization's vulnerabilities, the security team will consider
    the probability, or likelihood, of a ptential vulnerability being exploited within
    the construct of the organization's threat environment.
    
    likelihood of occurrence is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the
    probability that a given threat or set of threats is capable of exploiting a given
    vulnerability or set of vulnerabilities.
   
Impact:

    Impact is the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the consequences 
    of unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized modification of information
    system availability.
    
    
Risk Assessment:

    Risk assessment is defined as the process of identifying, estimating and prioritizing
    risks to an organization's operations (including its mission, functions, image and 
    reputation), assets, individuals, other organizations and even the nation. Risk
    asseessment should result in aligning (or associating) each identified risk resulting
    from the operation of an information system with the goals, objectives, assets or processes
    that the organization uses, which in turn aligns with or directly supports achieving the 
    organization's goals and objectives.
    
Risk Treatment:

    Risk treatment relates to making decisions about the best actions to take regarding
    the identified and prioritized risk. The decisions made are dependent on the attitude 
    of management toward risk and the availability and cost of risk mitigation.
    
 Avoidance:
 
    Risk avoidance is the decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely. This could 
    include ceasing operation for some or all of the activities of the organization that are
    exposed to a particular risk. Organization leadership may choose risk avoidance when the potential
    impact of a given risk is too high or if the likelihood of the risk being realized is simply too great.
    
Acceptance:

    Risk acceptance is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring. Management may
    opt for conducting the business function that is associated with the risk without any further
    action on the part of the organization, either because the impact or likelihood of occurrence
    is negligible, or because the benefit is more than enough to offset that risk.
    
Mitigation:

    Risk miigation is the most common type of risk managemnt and includes taking actions
    to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact. Mitigation can
    invole remediation measures, or controls, such as security controls, establishing
    policies, procedures, and standards to minimize adverse risk. Risk cannot always
    be mitigated, but mitigations such as safety measures should always be in place.
    
Transfer:

    Risk transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party, who will accept the 
    financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment.
    Typically, this is an insurance policy.
