The CIA Triad:

    To define security, it has become common to use Confidentiality,
    Integrity and Availability, also known as the CIA triad. The purpose
    of these terms is to describe security using relevant and meaningful 
    words that make security more understandable to management and users
    and define its purpose.
    
Confidentiality:

    Confidentiality relates to permitting authorized access to information,
    while at the same time protecting inforamtion from improper disclosure.
    
    Confidentiality is a difficult balance to achieve when many system users
    are guests or customers, and it is not known if they are accessing the system
    from a compromised machine or vulnerable mobile application. So the security
    professional;s obligation is to regulate access and protect the data that
    needs protection, yet permit access to authorized individuals.
    
Availability:

    Availability means that systems and data area accessible at the same time
    users need them.
    
Intergrity:

    Intergrity is the purpose of information whereby it is recorded, used and maintained
    in a way that ensures its completenesses, accuracy, internal consistency and usefulness for
    a stated purpose.
    
Personally Identifiable Informal PII:

    PII is a term related to the area of confidentiality. It pertains to any data
    about an individual that could be used to identify them. Other terms related
    to confidentiality are protected health information (PHI), which is information
    reagrading one's health status, and classified or sensitive information, which 
    includes trade secrets, research, business plans and intellectual property.
    
Sensitivity:

    Sensitivity is a measure of the importance assigned to information by
    its owner, or the purpose of denoting its need fro protection. Sensitive
    information is information that if improperly disclosed (confidentiality)
    or modified (integrity) would harm an organization or individual. In many
    cases, sensitivity is related to the harm  to external stakeholders; that is
    people or organizations that may not be part of the organization that processes 
    or uses the information.
    
Authentication:

    When users have stated their identity, it is necessary to validate
    that they are the rightful owners of that indentity. This process
    of verifying or proving the user's identification is known as 
    authentication. Simply put, authentication is a process to prove 
    the identity of the requestor.
    
There are three common methods of authentication:

    Something you know: Passwords or paraphrases.
    Somthing you have: Tokens, memory cards, smart cards.
    Somthing you are: Bimetrics, measurable characteristics.
    
Methods of Authentication:

     There are two types of authentication. Using only one of the methods of
     authentication stated previously is known as single-factor authentication
     (SFA). Granting users access only after successfully demonstrating or displaying
     two or more of these methods is known as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
     
Non-repudiation:

     Non-repudiation is a legal term and is defined as the protection against an
     individual falsely denying having performed a particular action. It provides the
     capability to determine whether a given individual took a particular action, such
     as created information, approved information or sent or received message.
     
Privacy:

    Privacy is the right of an individual to control the distribution of information
    about themselves.
    
    An example of a law with multinational about themselves implications is the 
    European Union's Gerneral Data Proctection Regulation (GDPR) which applies to
    all organizations, foreign or domestic, doing business in the EU or any persons
    in the EU. Companies operating or doing business within the United States may also
    fall under several state legislations that regulate the collection and use of consumer
    data and privacy. These laws, including national-and state-level laws, dictate that any
    entity anywhere in the world handling the private data of people in a particular
    legal jurisdiction must abide by its priavcy requirements.
